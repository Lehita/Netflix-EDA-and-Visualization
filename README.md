## Netflix Data Wrangling and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project
### ABOUT
#### As the name implies, this project is a data wrangling project. Netflix data was downloaded from kaggle.com and imported into a Jupyter Notebook. Using Python libraries such as Numpy, Matplotlib and Seaborn, the data was cleaned, transformed and visualized.
#### The data exploration process began with asking questions about the data (such as the most popular director, the most popular movie rating etc.) which were answered with the appropriate visuals. Insights were documented using Markdown cells in the notebook.
#### At the end of the analysis, I was able to discover the most popular movie director and most popular TV show director, the most used words in Netflix content description, the country with the highest count of Netflix movie production etc.
