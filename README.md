## Netflix Data Wrangling and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project
### ABOUT
#### As the name implies, this project is a data-wrangling project. Netflix data was downloaded from kaggle.com and imported into a Jupyter Notebook. Using Python libraries such as Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, WordCloud, Seaborn, etc., the data was cleaned, transformed and visualized.
#### The data exploration process began with asking questions about the data (such as the most used words in Netflix movies/TV shows descriptions) which were answered with the appropriate visuals. Insights were documented using Markdown cells in the notebook.
#### At the end of the analysis, I was able to:
#### -spot the trend in movies and TV show addition on Netflix
#### -find the top 10 countries of production
#### -discover the season Netflix is most likely to add new content to their platform
#### -the most popular ratings for Netflix movies and TV shows, and much more!
#### The notebook can be accessed in this repo. Snippets of the visualsðŸ‘‡
